# Introduction

This project provides convenient Docker images for Katalon Studio and other Selenium-based testing frameworks, with following requirements:

* Images are easy to deploy and use for people with limited Docker knowledge,
* Up-to-date browser versions (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox) from official installation packages,
* Testing frameworks and companion tools are fully installed and configured for common use cases,
* Compatible with Cloud and local-based CIs.

At this moment, the following images are available:

* Base: contains common software for doing Selenium testing: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Xvfb, Java SE Runtime Environment (OpenJDK).
* [Katalon Studio](https://hub.docker.com/r/katalonstudio/katalon/): used for creating containers that can execute Katalon Studio tests and write reports to host's file system.

Versions of important packages is written in `/katalon/version` (or `$KATALON_VERSION_FILE`).

    cat $KATALON_VERSION_FILE
    Google Chrome 67.0.3396.99
    Mozilla Firefox 61.0.1
    Katalon Studio 5.7.0

# Katalon Studio image

The container started from this image will expect following environment variables:
* `KATALON_OPTS`: all Katalon Studio console mode arguments except `-runMode`, `-reportFolder`, and `-projectPath`. For more details as well as an easy way to generate all arguments please refer to [the documentation](https://docs.katalon.com/display/KD/Console+Mode+Execution).

The following bind mounts should be used:

| Container's directory     | Host's directory  | Writable? |
| ------------------------- | ----------------- | --------- |
| /katalon/katalon/source | project directory | No - the source code will be copied to a temporary directory inside the container, therefore no write access is needed. |
| /katalon/katalon/report | report directory  | Yes - Katalon Studio will write execution report to this directory. |

If you need to configure proxy for Katalon Studio please use following parameters:

| Option Name          | Value Type | Values                              | Mandatory? |
| -------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------- |
| proxy.option         | Fixed      | NO_PROXY, USE_SYSTEM, MANUAL_CONFIG | YES        |
| proxy.server.type    | Fixed      | HTTP, HTTPS, or SOCKS               | YES        |
| proxy.server.address | String     | Examples: locahost, 192.168.1.221   | YES        |
| proxy.server.port    | Integer    | Examples: 8888, 8080                | YES        |
| proxy.username       | String	    | Example: MyProxyUsername            | Optional (YES if your proxy server requires authentication) |
| proxy.password       | String     | Example: MyProxyPasswordOptional    | (YES if your proxy server requires authentication) |

These proxy information will be passed to browsers executing the tests.

For example, the following script will execute a project at `/home/ubuntu/katalon-test` and write reports to `/katalon/katalon/report`. Do not forget to put `--config` before the proxy configuration.

    #!/usr/bin/env bash

    katalon_opts='-browserType="Chrome" -retry=0 -statusDelay=15 -testSuitePath="Test Suites/TS_RegressionTest" --config -proxy.option=MANUAL_CONFIG -proxy.server.type=HTTP -proxy.server.address=192.168.1.221 -proxy.server.port=8888'
    docker run --rm -v /home/ubuntu/katalon-test:/katalon/katalon/source:ro -v /home/ubuntu/report:/katalon/katalon/report -e KATALON_OPTS="$katalon_opts" katalonstudio/katalon
